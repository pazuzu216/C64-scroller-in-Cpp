# C64-scroller-in-Cpp
1x1 Text Scroller Class for LLVM-MOS for the Commodore 64

This is an experiment to see if LLVM-MOS can handle a simple scroller in C++. It does.

The scroller uses the character set from the C64 ROM, and the scroll register moves the text pixel by pixel. The code is written to be readable, not efficientâ€”optimization is left to the compiler. The routine attaches to the vertical blank interrupt.

To compile and modify this code, you will need the LLVM-MOS compiler, which is freely available on GitHub: LLVM-MOS on GitHub: https://github.com/llvm-mos/llvm-mos (Compile with: mos-c64-clang -O3 -o main.prg main.cc)


If you don't want to run this on original hardware, you can use the VICE emulator for testing: https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/

You are free to modify and use this code as you see fit.
